# Laundry-Warning-Hero
Monitoring real time weather using MySQL

## 1. Problem Statement
Housewives often have  to dry clothes outside after the laundry. This can be difficult when the weather is unpredictable or when they don't have a reliable way to check the current conditions. 

To address this problem, we want to build an IoT system that can measure the humidity levels in the air and predict when it is likely to rain, so that housewives can plan their laundry schedules accordingly.

The system should be easy to use, reliable, and accessible from anywhere, and it should provide real-time updates and alerts when rain is predicted. Additionally, the system should be cost-effective and environmentally friendly, using minimal resources and energy to operate.

## 4. Software Setup:

### 4.1 Setup HTTP protocal 
The given PHP code establishes a connection to a MySQL database using the mysqli_connect() function and stores the connection object in the $conn variable. The code then checks if the variables "temperature" and "humidity" are set in the $_POST superglobal array using the isset() function. If they are set, the code retrieves their values and stores them in the $t and $h variables.

The code then constructs an SQL INSERT statement using the retrieved temperature and humidity values and inserts them into the "dht11" table of the database using the mysqli_query() function. If the query is successful, the code outputs the message "New record created successfully". Otherwise, it outputs an error message along with the SQL query and the error message returned by mysqli_error().

To use this PHP file to receive data from an ESP32 via HTTP protocol, the ESP32 needs to send an HTTP POST request to this PHP file URL with the temperature and humidity values in the request body as key-value pairs. The ESP32 can use the HTTPClient library to make the HTTP request and include the temperature and humidity values in the request body. Once the PHP file receives the data, it inserts it into the MySQL database. This way, the ESP32 can send the temperature and humidity data to a server running the PHP file, which can store the data in a database for further analysis and visualization.

```
<?php

$hostname = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$database = "lwhero";

$conn = mysqli_connect($hostname, $username, $password, $database);
if(!$conn) {
	die ("connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

echo "Database connection is OK <br>";


if(isset($_POST["temperature"]) && isset($_POST["humidity"])) {
	$t = $_POST["temperature"];
	$h = $_POST["humidity"];


$sql = "INSERT INTO `dht11`( `temperature`, `humidity`) VALUES (".$t.",".$h.")";

if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {
	echo "New record created successfully";
} else {
	echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . mysqli_error($conn);
}

}
?>
```
### 4.1 XAMPP

The data received from the hardware is being kept in the mysql database. Then, it will be shown to the user every time the data is updated 

### 4.3 Django 
To install Django on the computer hosting the Ngrok server, you first need to ensure that Python is installed on the machine. Django is a Python web framework, so it requires Python to run. Once Python is installed, you can use the pip package manager to install Django. Open a command prompt or terminal window and enter the command "pip install Django" to begin the installation process. After Django is installed, you can configure it to connect to the MySQL database within Ngrok. This involves specifying the database connection details in the Django settings file, such as the database name, host, port, username, and password.

Once Django is connected to the MySQL database, you can start creating dashboards and panels to visualize weather data. This involves creating HTML templates that display temperature and humidity trends in a user-friendly way. Django provides a powerful templating engine that allows you to create reusable HTML templates with dynamic content. You can use Python code within the templates to generate the weather data and pass it to the HTML for display. With Django's built-in support for forms and models, you can create interactive dashboards and panels that allow users to filter and manipulate the weather data. Overall, Django provides a robust and flexible platform for building web applications that visualize weather data and other types of data.
